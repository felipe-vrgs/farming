  # GDScript linting (gdtoolkit / gdlint).
  #
  # NOTE: We intentionally do NOT run gdformat automatically because its formatting
  # rules are largely non-configurable (beyond line length/indent) and include
  # stylistic choices like "two blank lines between functions".

  # Project-local quality gates.
  #
  # - format-check: fast and deterministic; keep it on pre-commit.
  # - headless-tests: requires a local Godot binary; run it on pre-push by default
  #   to keep commit latency low. If you want it on every commit, add "pre-commit"
  #   to the stages list below.
